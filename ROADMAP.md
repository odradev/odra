# Odra Roadmap Process

This document covers the way we plan further development of the Odra.

Visit the the [Odra Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/odradev/projects/3) for details.

## Release Schedule

We maintain plans for at least three future releases.
We think it is a good balance between predictability and flexibility.

Future releases have assigned SemVer-based version numbers, but they are
subject to change in case of an unplanned required breaking change.

We release new versions approximately every 1-2 months or as needed.

## New Features

Everyone is encouraged to propose a new Odra feature or enhancement.
New proposals need to be discussed and approved by the core team.
When the feature is ready, we assign it to the one of the future release.
